# Hangman

## Table of Contents

### Project description: 
  Hangman is a fun game for players of all ages. It is simple, yet addictive that can be used to fill a rainy afternoon (or time relaxing in the sun!). 
  
  All you need to do is guess a letter to see if it's in an undisclosed word. If it is you will keep all your lives and you're one step closer. If your guess is wrong then you will lose a life (in this game you have 5) before you guess again. 
  
  This version of the game notifies you if you choose the same letter twice, and you will not lose a life for that. 

 - All the words are types of fruit. 

 - The aim of this project is to implement learnings about classes among other things, tying that in with previous lessions on function creation, loops and context managers.

 - I have learnt that classes are a great way to add functionality and encapsulate the code I have created. I've also enjoyed scrutinising my code to stick to DRY coding and making it readable with abstraction.
