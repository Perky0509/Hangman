### Project description: 
 - All the words are types of fruit. 

 - The aim of this project is to implement learnings about classes among other things, tying that in with previous lessions on function creation, loops and context managers.

 - I have learnt that classes are a great way to add functionality and encapsulate the code I have created. I've also enjoyed scrutinising my code to stick to DRY coding and making it readable with abstraction. 

### Installation instructions
  No special libraries used, simple python script
  import random used 

### Usage instructions
  To play simply run the function ask_for_input and then you'll be asked to input a letter. Good luck!
