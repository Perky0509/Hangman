### Project description: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - This is a game created for the user to guess if a letter is in a word randomly produced. It is designed to check if the input is a) a single letter (not just a single character) and b) if it's within the word. 
 - All the words are types of fruit. 

 - The aim of this project is to implement learnings about classes among other things, tying that in with previous lessions on function creation, loops and context managers.

 - I have learnt that classes are a great way to add functionality and encapsulate the code I have created. I've also enjoyed scrutinising my code to stick to DRY coding and making it readable with abstraction.
